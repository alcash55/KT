# Royalty VS Code Theme

This theme is available on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Alcash55.kingtheme)

## Inspiration

Inspiration for this theme came from colors of royalty during the 16th-19th centuries. During these times the colors represented:

- White: Purity
- Gold: Wealth
- Purple: Royalty
